One-page site that lets you click the vertically-aligned elements to show content within their expanded forms. For a friend's prior ROM hack collection. [Here is the page in live form.](https://mof.x10.bz/projects/thhg)

Unfortunately uses jquery, while also using [zoom.js](https://lab.hakim.se/zoom-js/) and work from Hakim El Hattab.

There is no license. Do what you want except that the original assets (basically all images) are not meant for reuse.
